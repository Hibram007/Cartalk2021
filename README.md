# Welcome to CarTalk

## Purpose
Cartalk is an app that was built with the purpose of allowing users to login or sign up into our app and then view car data and read reviews on the cars chosen.

The user is able once they are logged in to create their own reviews and comments. If they wish to update/edit or even delete a review they have written they are able to do so!

## Description
Our app is hosted on Heroku while having a remote DB on Jaws DB. The folder structure is built to the MVC paradigm standards. FInally, the app consists of a front end built on a mix of Handlebars templates, Html, css, and bootstrap. The back end was built using MySWL and Sequelize and then connected to the Jaws DB remote site. 

## Parts of the Project
Our project consists of a homepage, login/ sign up page, a dashboard page, and a single post page where users can edit/delete posts that were made.
